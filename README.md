Code Ready Containers Quick Loan Bank Demo
==========================================
This demo project showcases the tooling available in Red Hat Decision Manager implementing 
complex decision logic which can be exposed as a decision service. The Quick Loan Bank in this 
demo uses technical rules, decision tables, guided rules with a Domain Specific Language, and 
Excel decision tables to define its loan calculation and approval system.

You will be given examples of calling the rules as if using them from an application through 
the RestAPI that is exposed by the server. Furthermore, this demo provides a Node.js client 
application written in AngularJS and PatternFly that showcases how web applications can 
consume decision services deployed on the decision server.

This demo installs the Red Hat Decision Manager on OpenShift Container Platform on your local
machine. It's leveraging CodeReady Continers and delivers a fully functioning container-native 
development experience.


Install on Code Ready Containers 
--------------------------------
There are two options to install and run this project on the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP); use your own existing installation
or to install on CodeReady Containers which provides you with a local OCP cluster.

1. Ensure you have a CodeReady Containers installation:

  - your own CodeReady Containers installation, if using this you just need to set the variables to point to it in init.{sh|bat} script.

  - [CodeReady Containers Easy Install](https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/crc-quick-loan-bank-demo/-/archive/master/crc-quick-loan-bank-demo-master.zip)

3. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges:

```
   # If using your own installation just point to your CodeReady Containers IP address
   # as follows:
   #
   $ ./init.sh 192.168.99.100  # example for CRC.
```

```
   # If using the CodeReady Containers installation, just ensure a correctly set cluster 
   # address for the HOST_IP variable found at the top of the init.{sh|bat} files, for example:
   #
   # HOST_IP=api.crc.testing  
   # 
   # Now just run the script without any IP address arguments and it picks up that hostname as follows:
   #
   $ ./init.sh
```

Now log in to Red Hat Decision Manager to start developing containerized process automation projects (the address will be generated by OCP):

Notes:
-----
If for any reason the installation breaks or you want a new Red Hat Decision Manager installation, just remove the project appdev-in-cloud entry in the OpenShift console and re-run the installation.
